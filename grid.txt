Created a new SeamlessGridPanel class that:
Renders sprites directly in a grid with no spacing between them
Implements mouse hover effects for improved UI feedback
Shows item IDs with a semi-transparent background for better readability
Uses efficient viewport rendering that only draws visible items
Includes the progressive loading system with progress bar for large tilesets
Added a new BRUSHLIST_SEAMLESS_GRID option to the brush list types:
Can be selected via settings with "seamless grid" option
Supports direct selection without using the checkbox toggle
Updated the BrushPanel to support the new seamless grid:
The "Grid View" checkbox now creates a SeamlessGridPanel
Added support for the new option in the list type settings
Improved rendering efficiency:
Only renders sprites in the visible viewport plus a small margin
Uses lazy loading with a progress indicator for large tilesets
Sprites are rendered directly without button overhead
Added hover effects when the mouse moves over items
