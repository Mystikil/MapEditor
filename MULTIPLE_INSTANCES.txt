Running Multiple Instances of Remere's Map Editor
===============================================

By default, Remere's Map Editor is configured to run only one instance at a time. 
When you try to open another map file, it will be opened in the already running instance.

If you want to run multiple instances of the map editor simultaneously (3-5 separate instances as requested), 
you have several options:

1. Use the RunMultipleInstances.bat file
--------------------------------------------
The simplest way is to use the included batch file:

- Place the RunMultipleInstances.bat file in the same directory as your map editor executable
- Double-click RunMultipleInstances.bat to launch a new instance
- Repeat to open additional instances

2. Command Line Parameters
--------------------------------------------
You can launch the map editor with special command line parameters:

- -force-multi-instance
  This will force the application to launch a new instance regardless of your settings.
  Example: IdlerMapEditor.exe -force-multi-instance

- -multi-instance 1
  This will temporarily set the preference to allow multiple instances.
  Example: IdlerMapEditor.exe -multi-instance 1

3. Change the Preferences
--------------------------------------------
You can permanently change the settings in the preferences:

1. Open the map editor
2. Go to Edit > Preferences
3. In the "General" tab, uncheck "Open all maps in the same instance"
4. Click OK

After changing this setting, any new map opened from the file explorer will open in a separate instance.

4. Live Mapping Between Multiple Instances
--------------------------------------------
When using multiple instances with Live Mapping:

1. Each instance can host its own Live Mapping server on a different port
2. To connect between instances:
   - Host a server in one instance (File > Host Live Map)
   - In another instance, connect to that server (File > Join Live Map)
   - Use "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" as the address
   - The port is automatically assigned, check the console output for the exact port number

3. If you get connection errors when joining:
   - Make sure you use the correct port number
   - Try alternative local addresses (localhost or 127.0.0.1)
   - Check if your firewall is blocking connections
   - Note that 0.0.0.0 will not work for connecting; use localhost instead

Notes
--------------------------------------------
- Each instance runs independently, so any changes you make in one instance won't automatically appear in the others
- Each instance will use system resources (memory and CPU), so running many instances might slow down your computer
- If you're working on related map files, you might want to use the normal single-instance mode with multiple tabs instead
