1. Creature Search Issues
Problems:
Search Results: The current implementation lists all spawns, not just those matching the typed creature name.
Name Matching: It does not filter by the input or selected creature name.
Batching: It does not batch results or allow “Next”/pagination like the item search.
Result Formatting: It does not show the monster name in the results, just “Spawn at ...”.
Solution Plan:
Filter: Only show spawns/creatures whose name contains the typed string (case-insensitive, partial match).
Result Formatting: Show the creature name and position in the results.
Batching: Implement batching/pagination like the item search (e.g., show N results, allow “Next”).
Loose Creatures: Continue to show loose creatures (not in spawns) that match the search.
Respect List Selection: If a creature is selected from the list, search for that exact name.
2. Border Editor Window Access
Request:
Add a button/menu entry in the main menu bar (Idler main menu) to open the Border Editor Window, not just from the palette.
Solution Plan:
Add a new menu action in main_menubar.h/cpp for “Border Editor...”
Implement the handler to open BorderEditorDialog.
Add the action to the appropriate menu (e.g., “Tools” or “Edit”).
Next Steps
Let’s break this into two tasks:
A. Fix Creature Search Logic
Update the search to:
Filter by the typed string (case-insensitive, substring match).
Only show matching creatures (not all spawns).
Show the creature name in the result.
Batch results (e.g., 100 at a time, with “Next”).
If a creature is selected from the list, search for that exact name.
B. Add Border Editor to Main Menu
Add a menu item to open the Border Editor Window from the main menu bar.
I’ll start by gathering the relevant code for batching/pagination and menu actions, then implement both improvements.
Would you like me to proceed with both changes, or focus on one first? If both, I’ll start with the creature search fix.
