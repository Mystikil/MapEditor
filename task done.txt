 * ! CURRENT TASK: --- DONE IGNORE THIS TASK --- LOG:
 * Interactive Item ID Editing in Replace Items Dialog 
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Transform the static ID display in the replacement list into interactive input fields
 * 
 * Current Operation:
 * - Items are added to list with single replaceId and withId values
 * - IDs are displayed as static text in format "Replace: X With: Y"
 * 
 * Desired Changes:
 * - Create additional input field for replaceId range input and withId static input window left as is
 * - Allow range input in the format "2000-2010,2020" directly in the replaceId additional input field that if populated overloads the main replaceId input window so both for replaceId are present and for withId only the click input window
 * - Support both single IDs(click input window takes care of that) and ranges for the replaceId input
 * - after pressing Add query each item from range to be added 1 by 1 to the list for replaceId.range = withId input
 * 
 * Example Usage:
 * 1. User presses replaceId from palette and withId from palette normal use case
 * 2. User writes in the range for replaceId field and puts withId from palette and pressed Add button adds range of replaceId items to the list for replaceId.range = withId input
 * 3. System automatically handles the range mapping for replacement
 * 
 * Technical Requirements:
 * - Replace static text rendering with wxTextCtrl components
 * - Parse range inputs using existing range parsing logic
 * - Update item data immediately when input changes
 * - Maintain undo/redo compatibility
 * - Preserve item metadata and completion status
 * 
 * Visual Feedback:
 * - Input fields clearly show current values
 * - Invalid inputs are visually indicated
 * - Maintain arrow direction indicator for swap functionality
