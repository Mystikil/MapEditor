============================================
             MAP NOTES
============================================

This directory contains notes for maps edited with Remere's Map Editor.

Notes are saved in plain text files with the same name as the map file.
For example, notes for "mymap.otbm" will be saved as "mymap.txt" in this directory.

Each notes file contains:
- A status line (first line) indicating whether the map is COMPLETED or PENDING
- The actual notes text

Notes can be accessed from the Map menu in the editor by selecting "Notes..." or using Ctrl+N.

The notes feature allows you to:
- Keep track of tasks that need to be done on the map
- Mark a map as completed or pending
- Save notes that persist between editing sessions
- Automatically save notes while editing
